<h3>Long Bio</h3>
<p>Ryan Yang is a student at Hunter College exploring the connections between science, technology, and art. He's especially interested in how digital tools and physical materials can be combined to create thoughtful, hands-on experiences. With a growing focus on interactive media and experimental design, Ryan’s work is shaped by curiosity about how we relate to nature, technology, and our own bodies. He’s currently learning techniques in areas like coding, fabrication, and digital art, and enjoys experimenting with textures, light, and sound in simple, tactile ways. As he develops his practice, Ryan is interested in collaborative projects, playful experimentation, and making work that invites others to explore complex ideas through everyday materials and sensory interaction. - GTP GENERATED
