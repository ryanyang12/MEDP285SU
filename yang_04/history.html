            <h2>In the ancient world</h2>
            <div>
                <p>As early as the 7th millennium BC, lapis lazuli was mined in the Sar-i Sang mines, in Shortugai, and
                    in other mines in Badakhshan province in northeast Afghanistan. </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    Lapis lazuli artifacts, dated to 7570 BC, have been found at Bhirrana, which is the oldest site of
                    Indus
                    Valley civilisation. Lapis was highly valued by the Indus Valley Civilisation (7570–1900 BC). Lapis
                    beads have been found at Neolithic burials in Mehrgarh, the Caucasus, and as far away as Mauritania.
                    It
                    was used in the funeral mask of Tutankhamun (1341–1323 BC). <br></p>

                    A term for Blue was relatively rare in many forms of ancient art and decoration, and even in ancient
                    literature. The Ancient Greek poets described the sea as green, brown or "the colour of wine". The
                    colour is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible as 'tekhelet'. Reds, blacks, browns, and
                    ochres
                    are found in cave paintings from the Upper Paleolithic period, but not blue. Blue was also not used
                    for
                    dyeing fabric until long after red, ochre, pink, and purple. This is probably due to the perennial
                    difficulty of making blue dyes and pigments. On the other hand, the rarity of blue pigment made it
                    even
                    more valuable. <br></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The earliest known blue dyes were made from plants – woad in Europe, indigo in Asia and Africa,
                    while
                    blue pigments were made from minerals, usually either lapis lazuli or azurite, and required more.
                    Blue
                    glazes posed still another challenge since the early blue dyes and pigments were not thermally
                    robust.
                    In c. 2500 BC, the blue glaze Egyptian blue was introduced for ceramics, as well as many other
                    objects.
                    The Greeks imported indigo dye from India, calling it indikon, and they painted with Egyptian blue.
                    Blue
                    was not one of the four primary colours for Greek painting described by Pliny the Elder (red,
                    yellow,
                    black, and white). For the Romans, blue was the colour of mourning, as well as the colour of
                    barbarians.
                    The Celts and Germans reportedly dyed their faces blue to frighten their enemies, and tinted their
                    hair
                    blue when they grew old. The Romans made extensive use of indigo and Egyptian blue pigment, as
                    evidenced, in part, by frescos in Pompeii. The Romans had many words for varieties of blue,
                    including
                    caeruleus, caesius, glaucus, cyaneus, lividus, venetus, aerius, and ferreus, but two words, both of
                    foreign origin, became the most enduring; blavus, from the Germanic word blau, which eventually
                    became
                    bleu or blue; and azureus, from the Arabic word lazaward, which became azure. <br></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Blue was widely used in the decoration of churches in the Byzantine Empire. By contrast, in the
                    Islamic
                    world, blue was of secondary to green, believed to be the favourite colour of the Prophet Mohammed.
                    At
                    certain times in Moorish Spain and other parts of the Islamic world, blue was the colour worn by
                    Christians and Jews, because only Muslims were allowed to wear white and green. <br>

            <h2>Middle Ages</h2>
            <div></div>
            <p>In the art and life of Europe during the early Middle Ages, blue played a minor role. This changed
                dramatically between 1130 and 1140 in Paris, when the Abbe Suger rebuilt the Saint Denis Basilica. Suger
                considered that light was the visible manifestation of the Holy Spirit. He installed stained glass
                windows coloured with cobalt, which, combined with the light from the red glass, filled the church with
                a bluish violet light. The church became the marvel of the Christian world, and the colour became known
                as the "bleu de Saint-Denis". In the years that followed even more elegant blue stained glass windows
                were installed in other churches, including at Chartres Cathedral and Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>In the 12th century the Roman Catholic Church dictated that painters in Italy (and the rest of Europe
                    consequently) to paint the Virgin Mary with blue, which became associated with holiness, humility
                    and virtue. In medieval paintings, blue was used to attract the attention of the viewer to the
                    Virgin Mary. Paintings of the mythical King Arthur began to show him dressed in blue. The coat of
                    arms of the kings of France became an azure or light blue shield, sprinkled with golden fleur-de-lis
                    or lilies. Blue had come from obscurity to become the royal colour.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Renaissance through 18th century</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Blue came into wider use beginning in the Renaissance, when artists began to paint the world with
                    perspective, depth, shadows, and light from a single source. In Renaissance paintings, artists tried
                    to create harmonies between blue and red, lightening the blue with lead white paint and adding
                    shadows and highlights. Raphael was a master of this technique, carefully balancing the reds and the
                    blues so no one colour dominated the picture. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p> Ultramarine was the most prestigious blue of the Renaissance, being more expensive than gold.
                    Wealthy art patrons commissioned works with the most expensive blues possible. In 1616 Richard
                    Sackville commissioned a portrait of himself by Isaac Oliver with three different blues, including
                    ultramarine pigment for his stockings. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p> An industry for the manufacture of fine blue and white pottery began in the 14th century in
                    Jingdezhen, China, using white Chinese porcelain decorated with patterns of cobalt blue, imported
                    from Persia. It was first made for the family of the Emperor of China, then was exported around the
                    world, with designs for export adapted to European subjects and tastes. The Chinese blue style was
                    also adapted by Dutch craftsmen in Delft and English craftsmen in Staffordshire in the 17th-18th
                    centuries. in the 18th century, blue and white porcelains were produced by Josiah Wedgwood and other
                    British craftsmen. </p>
            </div>
            <h2>19th-20th century</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The early 19th century saw the ancestor of the modern blue business suit, created by Beau Brummel
                    (1776–1840), who set fashion at the London Court. It also saw the invention of blue jeans, a highly
                    popular form of workers's costume, invented in 1853 by Jacob W. Davis who used metal rivets to
                    strengthen blue denim work clothing in the California gold fields. The invention was funded by San
                    Francisco entrepreneur Levi Strauss, and spread around the world. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Recognizing the emotional power of blue, many artists made it the central element of paintings in the
                    19th and 20th centuries. They included Pablo Picasso, Pavel Kuznetsov and the Blue Rose art group,
                    and Kandinsky and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) school. Henri Matisse expressed deep emotions
                    with blue, "A certain blue penetrates your soul." In the second half of the 20th century, painters
                    of the abstract expressionist movement use blues to inspire ideas and emotions. Painter Mark Rothko
                    observed that colour was "only an instrument;" his interest was "in expressing human emotions
                    tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on".
