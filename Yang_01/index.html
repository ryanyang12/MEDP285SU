    <h4>Do you have experience with coding(html, css, javascript)?</h4>
    <p>I had experience with p5.js through creative coding and python but really little.</p>
    <h4>Do you have a media production superpower(Photography, Animation, Illustration, etc)?</h4>

    <p>I dont have any superpowers but if I would chose from one of the adobe application I would choose preimer pro. I enjoy the editing part of media more than everything else.
